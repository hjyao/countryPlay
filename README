Get Started
===========
1. Check the database configuration in the following files:
	* src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/persistence-config.xml


2. Start postgres server and setup database
    * check that the postgres superuser exists
      run "psql -c '\du'"
    * if user does not exist
        run "createuser -s postgres" (no need to set a password, defaults to 'postgres')
    * create database trailblazers
      run "./tools/ant/bin/ant init-db"
    * to add some data
      run "psql -h localhost -U postgres --password -d trailblazers < db/backup.sql"


3. Check out existing tasks
    * go to the project root folder
    * ./gradlew tasks


4. Run local build
    * ./gradlew clean build


5. Check testing coverage
    * open build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html


6. Start the server
	* ./gradlew jettyRun
	* go to http://localhost:8080/


Set Up Your IntelliJ Project
===========
1. Checkout the code
2. run "./gradlew cleanIdea idea"
3. Open IntelliJ IDEA
4. Click “Open Project” -> Choose the “twuXXprojX” folder that you just checked out from source control (Or use "File" -> “Open…”)
5. If you see a popup in which IntelliJ wants to use your confidential information in you keychain, click “Allow” or “Always Allow”
6. If you see an error with the Java SDK being set incorrectly, follow the instructions in IntelliJ to set the Project SDK to Java 1.7
7. To verify that the import was successful:
	a. Make sure your database is set up and Postgres is running
	b. Go to the project root directory, run "./gradlew jettyRun"
	c. Run all the tests from IntelliJ
	d. If everything is green, you are good to go!
